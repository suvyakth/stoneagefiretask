 <h2><b>Four steps to make a fire.</b></h2>
  <p>
1.First to make a fire (â€˜be sure to have a very dry surface and clear away leaves Etc away) you have to get materials: Tinder dried materials such as shredded bark, leaves or grass, small sticks or small branches, and Fuel Wood.<br></br>
2.Take tinder material and make a ball in the place you want to make a fire ,take your small sticks and put them around like a tea following, lean pieces of Fuel wood against the small sticks.<br></br>
3.Then take a long piece of Fuel wood and take a flint stone and rub it against the wood and hold it with your leg so it doesn't move.(rub near the ball that you had made previously)<br></br>
4.Lastly the rubbing will start to become a spark. At this time you can blow on the sparkes, a little time later you will see a FIRE!!!<br></br>
<b>SAFETY</b>:: You have to have sand or water if the fire starts to spread to put the fire off.
